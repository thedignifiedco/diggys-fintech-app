Don’t have an account yet? No worries. This project includes **sandbox credentials** so you can test it right away!


## Get started in 3 simple steps

If you don’t have a Frontegg account or prefer to use the sandbox credentials, feel free to skip to step **2**.

If you're using your own credentials, follow the guidelines below.

### 1. Configure your Frontegg application (if using your own account) -

2. Get your application ID from [ENVIRONMENT] → Applications
3. Get your Frontegg domain from the Frontegg Portal → [ENVIRONMENT] → Keys & domains
4. This sample runs on `http://localhost:3000`. You may need to add `http://localhost:3000` under → [ENVIRONMENT] → Keys & domains → Allowed origins
5. Update your own application's credentials under `/src/constants/config.js`

### 2. Clone the repository - 

Run the following command:

```bash
npm clone <repo>
```

### 3. Install dependencies -

```bash
npm install
```
